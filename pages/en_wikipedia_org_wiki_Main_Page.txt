Volpe created "I'm God" in 2009 by sampling Heap's 2005 song "Just for Now". Volpe sent the track to the rapper Lil B; the instrumental is featured on a song of the same name on Lil B's 2009 mixtape, 6 Kiss. Volpe self-released "I'm God" in 2011 and, in 2012, it appeared on his mixtape Instrumentals 2. It was officially released on streaming on April 24, 2020, appearing on Volpe's Instrumental Relics compilation. A cloud rap song, "I'm God" is noted for its ethereal and dream-like aspects. It received a cult following on the Internet, being unofficially reuploaded by fans to social media, including in the form of a music video that incorporates clips from the 1989 French film Perdues dans New York. "I'm God" went on to be influential in the genre of cloud rap. It was certified gold in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America. (Full article...)
