He was a distance runner and basketball player, and continued both pursuits after his right leg was amputated upon being diagnosed with osteosarcoma in 1977. His chemotherapy inspired him to attempt the Marathon of Hope, a cross-Canada run, to raise funds for cancer research. He began on April 12, 1980, at St. John's, Newfoundland, and ran west for 143 days and 5,373 kilometres (3,339 mi) – the equivalent of a marathon a day – until forced to stop near Thunder Bay, Ontario, after cancer returned in his lungs. Fox captivated the country; he was named Newsmaker of the Year in both 1980 and 1981 and appointed Companion of the Order of Canada. His run led to millions of dollars in donations. He inspired the Terry Fox Run, held in more than 60 countries and the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research. Considered a national hero, buildings, roads and parks across Canada have been named in his honour. (Full article...)
