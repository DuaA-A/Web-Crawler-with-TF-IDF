They were published by Günter Dreyer the following year.[1] The impressions are the earliest confirmed king list for ancient Egypt.[2] The names are listed in following order: Narmer Hor-Aha Djer Djet Den Merneith (Den's mother and regent) The list bolsters the argument that Narmer was the founder of the First Dynasty as opposed to being the last of the pre-unification kings of Thinis. Also of importance is the absence of Menes as scholarly consensus believe Menes was a later variation of Narmer's name.[1] References [edit] ^ a b Cervello-Autuori, Josep (2003).
